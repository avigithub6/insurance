# Insurance Customer Response Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is designed to predict customer responses for insurance-related queries using machine learning techniques. The notebook `Insurance_Customer_Response_Prediction.ipynb` contains data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation steps.

## 📂 Files in Repository
- **Insurance_Customer_Response_Prediction.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire pipeline.
- **data/**: Folder to store dataset files (if applicable).
- **models/**: Saved machine learning models (if applicable).
- **README.md**: Documentation of the project.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data handling)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning Models)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Insurance-Customer-Prediction.git
   cd Insurance-Customer-Prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run `Insurance_Customer_Response_Prediction.ipynb` step by step.

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**: Handling missing values and duplicates.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data trends and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Encoding categorical variables and feature scaling.
4. **Model Selection & Training**: Training ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
5. **Evaluation & Prediction**: Model performance analysis using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📝 Future Improvements
